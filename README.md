# Weather-Forecaster

## The Project

This project was designed to allow users to see a quick weekly forecast of a city for the current week. By using a city name and two letter country code, users are able to have various items populate into weekly forecast fields with relevant information for each day of the week.

## Usage

The project will immediately ask to use your current location, upon acceptance the various fields will populate to give you a weather forecast for your current area! Declining the current location prompt still allows users to search, but fields will simply have placeholder values until the search is completed.
